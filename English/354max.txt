The 354-Max are the best, and only, bionic legs for fishes. It includes all the regular features you expect on a nice pair of legs, like
knees, thighs and if you really love your aquatic little friend, ankles. Who said a fish can't climb the Mount Everest? Whoever did,
it's wrong, with our new revolutionary product, your goldy little friend could now do anything a being with legs could do, like:

· Clean their own fish tank, it would be easy for them with a good and formidable pair of strong legs, you'll have to teach them although

· Help you take out the trash, It is not a mystery that fishes have strong jaws that can be used to carry heavy bags of rubbish

· Help you with your PE homework, this is pretty self explanatory isn't it? Nobody likes doing their PE homework, why not have
your fish do it for you?

This and many more posibilities could be done with one product, if you order now, we will include the bag of water gadget, that will allow
your aquatic friend to be out of the water more than 20 seconds. Just make sure that there's isn't sharp objects near him, it could be 
a catastrophe.
